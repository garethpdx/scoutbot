ScoutBot - a bot to monitor HelpScout and provide alerts via Slack
====

This bot serves to glue together three systems:

* HelpScout - the ticket system we use to get requests from our clients

* Slack - the chat system we hang out in all day

* Google Calender - the calendar system we use to record who's on support (i.e. responsible for responding to tickets that come in)

The bot currently can:

* Tell you who's on support now, today, tomorrow or N days in the future.

* Tell you the current status of tickets in HelpScout including which need replies and how long the client has been waiting.

Soon it will:

* Alert the person on support when a ticket is waiting for too long.

* Alert everyone when a ticket has been waiting much too long.
